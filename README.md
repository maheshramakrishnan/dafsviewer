Simple GUI based program to perform peak fitting and corrections to powder DAFS data. User inputs include an integrated 2D map (Q (x-axis) vs Energy), an XAS data file (current or fluorescence I0 and I1). Currently the integrated data uses a non-transformed Q-axis (integrated based on a same PONI file for all energies, to reduce interpolation errors). For fast azimuthal integration of 2D data, please look at https://github.com/maxiv-science/azint. The code needs to be modified to read these data files. Two corrections (for I0 and integration time) possible now, expandable later. Curve fitting uses standard SciPy libraries.
